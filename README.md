Assignment 1 - Research Track 1
================================

Introduction
------------

In this assignment we are asked to let the robot `constantly drive around the circuit in the counter-clockwise direction`, `avoiding all the gold boxes`. When a silver token in found along the path, the robot should also `grab it and move it behind himself.`

Installing and running
----------------------

The simulator requires a Python 2.7 installation, the [pygame](http://pygame.org/) library, [PyPyBox2D](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypybox2d/2.1-r331), and [PyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML/).

Pygame, unfortunately, can be tricky (though [not impossible](http://askubuntu.com/q/312767)) to install in virtual environments. If you are using `pip`, you might try `pip install hg+https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame`, or you could use your operating system's package manager. Windows users could use [Portable Python](http://portablepython.com/). PyPyBox2D and PyYAML are more forgiving, and should install just fine using `pip` or `easy_install`.

Run
-----------------------------

To run the assignment in the simulator, use `run.py`, passing it the file name `assignment1.py`, as the following:

```bash
$ python run.py assignment1.py
```

Robot API
---------

The API for controlling a simulated robot is designed to be as similar as possible to the [SR API][sr-api].

### Motors ###

The simulated robot has two motors configured for skid steering, connected to a two-output [Motor Board](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/motor_board). The left motor is connected to output `0` and the right motor to output `1`.

The Motor Board API is identical to [that of the SR API](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/sr/motors/), except that motor boards cannot be addressed by serial number. So, to turn on the motors, one might write the following:

```python
R.motors[0].m0.power = 10
R.motors[0].m1.power = -10
```
This simple snippet is used in two important functions, `drive(speed,seconds)` and `turn(speed,seconds)` to let the robot move straight or turn.

### The Grabber ###

The robot is equipped with a grabber, capable of picking up a token which is in front of the robot and within 0.4 metres of the robot's centre. To pick up a token, call the `R.grab` method:

```python
success = R.grab()
```

The `R.grab` function returns `True` if a token was successfully picked up, or `False` otherwise. If the robot is already holding a token, it will throw an `AlreadyHoldingSomethingException`.

To drop the token, call the `R.release` method.


### Vision ###

To help the robot find tokens and navigate, each token has markers stuck to it, as does each wall. The `R.see` method returns a list of all the markers the robot can see, as `Marker` objects. The robot can only see markers which it is facing towards.

Each `Marker` object has many attributes, included:

* `info`: a `MarkerInfo` object describing the marker itself. The program uses:
  * `code`: the numeric code of the marker.
  * `marker_type`: the type of object the marker is attached to (either `MARKER_TOKEN_GOLD`, `MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER` or `MARKER_ARENA`).
* `dist`: the distance from the centre of the robot to the object (in metres).
* `rot_y`: rotation about the Y axis in degrees.

For example, the following code fitlter only the golden markers the robot can see:

```python
for token in R.see():
        if token.info.marker_type is MARKER_TOKEN_GOLD:
            ...
            ...
            ...
```

The code
--------


### drive around the circuit ###
In order to successfully drive around the circuit, the robot must have the capability of recognize and manage an angle.

To do so, the function `see_forward()` is called. This function returns the minimum distance of a golden box found in front of the robot. If the distance is less than `g_th = 1.0`, the robot is going towards a wall, which means he's approaching an angle.

The program also implements a function called `detect_angle()` which recognize the type of angle (need to turn left or turn right) and returns the turn direction.

Here's how it's implemented:

```python
def detect_angle():
    """
    Function to understand how an angle is made and how the robot should turn

    Returns:
	direction (int): 1 if it has to turn clockwise, -1 if counterclockwise 
    """
    distCcw=100 #distance counterclockwise
    distCw=100 #distance clockwise
    for token in R.see():
        if  70<=token.rot_y<=110  and token.dist < distCw and token.info.marker_type is MARKER_TOKEN_GOLD:
            distCw=token.dist
        elif -110<=token.rot_y<=-90  and token.dist < distCcw and token.info.marker_type is MARKER_TOKEN_GOLD:
            distCcw=token.dist         
    if distCw==100:
	    return -1
    else:
        if distCw>distCcw:
            return 1
        else:
            return -1
```

After doing that, the robot turns according to the retrun value of the last described function.

Immediately after, the robot aligns himself with the next reachable silver token, if present, using a function called `align_to_next_silver_token(direction)`:

```python
def align_to_next_silver_token(turn_direction): 
    """
    Function to align to the next silver token after a turn
    """    
    
    if not look_for_silver_token(35): return
    else:
        silv_tok=None
        unreachable = []
        dist=100
        
        # creates a list of unreachable silver tokens, that must be ignored
        for token1 in R.see():
                if token1.info.marker_type is MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER:
                    for token in R.see():
                        if -token1.rot_y-0.5<=token.rot_y<=token1.rot_y+0.5 and token.dist<token1.dist
			   and token.info.marker_type is MARKER_TOKEN_GOLD:
                            unreachable.append(token.info.code)
                            break
                        
        # extra vision to one side or another according to the turn direction
        # in order to manage unexpected turn behavior              
        lower_angle_limit = -35 - 20 if turn_direction==1 else 0
        upper_angle_limit = 35 + 20 if turn_direction==-1 else 0
        
        
        # look for the nearest reachable silver token
        for token in R.see():
                if lower_angle_limit<=token.rot_y<=upper_angle_limit and token.dist<dist 
		   and not token.info.code in unreachable and token.info.marker_type is MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER:
                    dist=token.dist
                    silv_tok=token
                    break 
                               
        if silv_tok==None: return
        
        
        print("Aligning with next token...")
	
	# if the robot is not well aligned with the token, we move it on the left or on the right
        while silv_tok.rot_y < -0.5 or silv_tok.rot_y > 0.5: 
                if silv_tok.rot_y < -0.5: 
                    turn(-2, 0.1)
                elif silv_tok.rot_y > 0.5:
                    turn(+2, 0.1)
                for token in R.see():
                    if -35<=token.rot_y<=35 and token.dist<dist and token.info.marker_type is MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER:
                     silv_tok=token
    print("Alignment complete!")                              
    return 
```

### Avoiding golden boxes ###

the robot is capable of correct himself if he's going towards a "wall". Every tenth of a second the robot check where the closest golden box is. If it is closer than `border_th = 0.55`, it makes a quick turn in the opposite direction and goes away from that box. Here's how he does it:

```python
dist,rot_y = find_golden_token()         
    if dist <border_th:
        if 0<rot_y<150:
            print(rot_y)
            print("Danger! Left a bit...")
            turn(-45, 0.2)
            drive(20,0.5)
        elif -150<rot_y<0:
            print(rot_y)
            print("Danger! Right a bit...")
            turn(45, 0.2)
            drive(20,0.5)
```

### Finding and grabbing a silver box ###

While the robot moves along the path, it also look for all the silver tokens, and tries to grab them and move them behind him. First he sees if there is a token in front of him, using this function:


```python
def look_for_silver_token(angle):  
    """
    Function to see if there is a silver token in front of the robot

    Returns:
	silverTokenForward (bool): presence of a silver token
    """
    silverTokenForward = False
    for token in R.see():
        if -angle<=token.rot_y<=angle and token.info.marker_type is MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER:
            silverTokenForward = True
    return silverTokenForward
```

Then, if something is found, he gets the how far the token is and how much he should turn in order to reach it, using the return values of this function:


```python
def find_silver_token():
    """
    Function to find the closest silver token

    Returns:
	dist (float): distance of the closest silver token (-1 if no silver token is detected)
	rot_y (float): angle between the robot and the silver token (-1 if no silver token is detected)
    """
    dist=100
    for token in R.see():
        if token.dist < dist and token.info.marker_type is MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER:
            dist=token.dist
	    rot_y=token.rot_y
    if dist==100:
	    return -1, -1
    else:
   	    return dist, rot_y
```
After that, the robot goes towards the token, avoiding all the golden token.

The following code is used to approach the silver token:

```python
a_th = 4.0
""" float: Threshold for the control of the linear distance"""

if rot_y<-30 or rot_y>30 or-a_th<= rot_y <= a_th: 
# if a silver token is found behind or if the robot 
# is well aligned with the next silver token we let it move straight
  drive(drive_v , 0.1)
  
# if the robot is not well aligned with the token, 
# we slightly move it on the left or on the right  
elif rot_y < -a_th: 
  turn(-2, 0.1)
elif rot_y > a_th:
  turn(+2, 0.1)
```

When the robot is at least at 0.4 meters from the token, he's able to grab it and move it behind himself using this code:

```python
d_th = 0.4
""" float: Threshold for the control of the orientation"""

if dist <d_th and -a_th<= rot_y <= a_th : # if we are close to the token, we try grab it.
                print("Found it!")
                if R.grab(): 
		# if we grab the token, we move the robot forward and on the right, 
		# we release the token, and we go back to the initial position
                    print("Gotcha!")
                    turn(30, 2)
                    R.release()
                    drive(-20,1)
                    turn(-30,2)
            
                else:
                    print("Aww, I'm not close enough.")
                    drive(drive_v , 0.1)
```
